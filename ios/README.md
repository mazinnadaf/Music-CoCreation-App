# SyncFlow iOS - AI Music Co-Creation App

A SwiftUI implementation of the SyncFlow AI music co-creation platform, designed for iOS with native performance and intuitive touch interactions.

## Features

### ✨ **Immediate Creation Experience**

- Pre-populated prompts for instant magic
- Guided onboarding with suggested next steps
- Fast AI generation simulation (2-5 seconds)
- Auto-play new layers for instant gratification

### 🎵 **Advanced Audio Interface**

- Real-time waveform visualization with animated bars
- Interactive audio player with play/pause controls
- Multi-layer synchronization and playback
- Visual progress indicators and time displays

### 🌍 **Social Discovery**

- Discovery feed with tracks, stems, and collaboration requests
- Filter by content type (tracks, stems, collaborations)
- Like, share, and collaboration features
- Open stems for remixing and building upon

### 🎨 **Modern Design System**

- Dark theme optimized for creative work
- Purple-to-blue gradient branding
- Smooth animations and micro-interactions
- iOS Human Interface Guidelines compliance

## Architecture

### **MVVM + Combine**

- `AudioManager`: Main state management with `@Published` properties
- Reactive UI updates with SwiftUI bindings
- Centralized audio layer management

### **Modular Components**

- `AudioPlayerView`: Reusable player with waveform visualization
- `TrackCardView`: Social feed item with interaction controls
- `CollaborationCTAView`: Call-to-action for social features

### **Design System**

- `DesignSystem.swift`: Centralized colors, gradients, and styles
- Custom button styles and view modifiers
- Consistent spacing and typography

## Key SwiftUI Features

### **State Management**

```swift
@StateObject private var audioManager = AudioManager()
@State private var selectedFilter: Track.TrackType? = nil
@State private var likedTracks: Set<UUID> = []
```

### **Custom Animations**

```swift
.scaleEffect(layer.isPlaying ? 1.05 : 1.0)
.animation(.easeInOut(duration: 0.1), value: layer.isPlaying)
```

### **Gradient Design System**

```swift
extension LinearGradient {
    static let primaryGradient = LinearGradient(
        colors: [Color.primaryPurple, Color.primaryBlue],
        startPoint: .topLeading,
        endPoint: .bottomTrailing
    )
}
```

### **Custom Button Styles**

```swift
struct GradientButtonStyle: ButtonStyle {
    func makeBody(configuration: Configuration) -> some View {
        configuration.label
            .background(LinearGradient.primaryGradient)
            .scaleEffect(configuration.isPressed ? 0.96 : 1.0)
    }
}
```

## Core User Flow

1. **Launch** → Immediate creation interface with pre-filled prompt
2. **Create First Layer** → AI generates melody, auto-plays in loop
3. **Guided Second Layer** → Suggestion to add drums with tooltip
4. **Layer Building** → Stack multiple layers with sync playback
5. **Social Introduction** → Share and collaboration prompts
6. **Discovery** → Browse community tracks and open collaborations

## iOS-Specific Optimizations

- **Native Performance**: SwiftUI with efficient state management
- **Touch Interactions**: Optimized for iPhone and iPad gestures
- **Haptic Feedback**: Planned for button presses and interactions
- **Accessibility**: VoiceOver support and dynamic type scaling
- **Background Audio**: Future support for background playback

## Getting Started

1. Open `ios/SyncFlow.xcodeproj` in Xcode 15+
2. Select your target device or simulator
3. Build and run (⌘R)

## Next Steps

- **Audio Engine Integration**: Replace mock audio with real audio processing
- **Social Backend**: Connect to collaboration and sharing APIs
- **AI Integration**: Connect to actual AI music generation service
- **Push Notifications**: Collaboration requests and social updates
- **iCloud Sync**: Cross-device project synchronization
