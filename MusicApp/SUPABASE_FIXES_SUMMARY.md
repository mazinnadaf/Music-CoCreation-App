# Supabase Database Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Table Structure Issues**
- Fixed the `tracks` table to include all required columns including `layer_id`
- Added proper foreign key constraints with `ON DELETE SET NULL` for collaborations
- Added default values for metadata columns

### 2. **User Profile Management**
- Changed from using a separate `profiles` table to using the `users` table
- Updated `SupabaseManager.swift` to use `users` table instead of `profiles`
- Created triggers to automatically create user profiles when users sign up

### 3. **Authentication Flow**
- Added `handle_new_user()` trigger function that runs after user signup
- Automatically creates a user profile in the `users` table with artist_name from signup metadata
- Added `handle_user_update()` trigger to keep email in sync

### 4. **Row Level Security (RLS)**
- Ensured all tables have RLS enabled
- Created appropriate policies for authenticated users
- Added proper permissions for tracks insertion

### 5. **Logging and Debugging**
- Added comprehensive logging to `saveTrack` function
- Added logging to authentication flow
- Better error handling and reporting

## Key Changes Made

### Database Migrations Applied:
1. `20250720160114_update_tables_for_app.sql` - Initial table updates
2. `20250720181600_fix_tracks_table.sql` - Fixed tracks table structure
3. `20250720182000_comprehensive_fix.sql` - Comprehensive fixes including triggers

### Code Changes:
1. **SupabaseManager.swift**:
   - Changed `fetchUserProfile()` to `fetchUser()` using `users` table
   - Updated `createUserProfile()` to insert into `users` table
   - Added detailed logging to `saveTrack()` function
   - Fixed user profile creation flow

2. **AudioModels.swift**:
   - Renamed `getAPIKey()` to `getBeatovenAPIKey()`
   - Added validation to prevent Supabase keys being used for Beatoven API

## Testing Instructions

1. **Sign Up a New User**:
   - The user profile should be automatically created in the `users` table
   - Check the console logs for successful profile creation

2. **Create a Track**:
   - Generate audio using Beatoven
   - The track should be saved to Supabase
   - Check console logs for detailed information about the save operation

3. **Check Database**:
   - Users table should have entries for signed-up users
   - Tracks table should have entries for created tracks

## Console Log Examples

When everything is working correctly, you should see logs like:

```
[Auth] User profile loaded successfully: testuser
[Supabase] Saving track with:
[Supabase]   - User ID: 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000
[Supabase]   - Layer ID: 987fcdeb-51a2-43f1-b321-123456789abc
[Supabase]   - Track URL: /path/to/audio.wav
[Supabase]   - Collaboration ID: nil
[Supabase]   - Metadata: ["instrument": "All", "bpm": 120]
[Supabase] Track saved successfully
```

## Troubleshooting

If tracks are still not saving:

1. **Check Authentication**: Ensure user is logged in (`currentUser` is not nil)
2. **Check Console Logs**: Look for error messages in Xcode console
3. **Verify Database**: Check if user exists in `users` table
4. **Check Supabase Dashboard**: Look at the authentication logs and database logs

## Next Steps

- Monitor the application logs when creating tracks
- If issues persist, check the Supabase dashboard for:
  - Authentication logs
  - Database logs
  - Failed queries
  - RLS policy violations
