# Firebase iOS App Requirements
# =============================

# DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT
# ----------------------
Xcode 15.0+
iOS 17.0+ (deployment target)
macOS (required for iOS development)
Swift 5.9+

# FIREBASE DEPENDENCIES (Swift Package Manager)
# ---------------------------------------------
# Add these packages in Xcode: File â†’ Add Packages...
# Package URL: https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk
# Required packages:
# - FirebaseAuth
# - FirebaseFirestore  
# - FirebaseStorage
# - FirebaseCore

# FIREBASE PROJECT SETUP
# ----------------------
# 1. Create Firebase project at: https://console.firebase.google.com
# 2. Add iOS app with your bundle ID
# 3. Download GoogleService-Info.plist
# 4. Add plist to Xcode project

# FIREBASE SECURITY RULES
# -----------------------

# Firestore Rules (Database â†’ Rules):
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      match /clips/{clipId} {
        allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      }
    }
  }
}

# Storage Rules (Storage â†’ Rules):
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /users/{userId}/clips/{fileName} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}

# AUTHENTICATION SETUP
# --------------------
# 1. Firebase Console â†’ Authentication
# 2. Enable Email/Password sign-in method
# 3. No additional configuration needed

# TESTING CHECKLIST
# ----------------
# [ ] App builds without errors
# [ ] Can create account with email/password
# [ ] Can log in with created account
# [ ] Can generate music clips
# [ ] Clips are saved to Firebase (check console logs)
# [ ] Clips persist after app restart
# [ ] Can play saved clips

# EXPECTED CONSOLE LOGS
# ---------------------
# When creating clip:
# [Firebase] ðŸ”„ Starting save for layer: My Song (ID: abc123)
# [Firebase] âœ… Audio file uploaded successfully
# [Firebase] âœ… Got download URL: https://storage.googleapis.com/...
# [Firebase] âœ… Layer metadata saved to Firestore successfully

# When loading clips:
# [Auth] ðŸ”„ User authenticated: user123
# [Auth] âœ… User profile loaded successfully
# [Auth] ðŸ“¢ Sending userAuthenticated notification
# [App] ðŸ”„ Loading user clips...
# [Firebase] ðŸ”„ Loading clips for user: user123
# [Firebase] ðŸ“„ Found 2 clips in Firestore
# [Firebase] âœ… Loaded clip: My Song
# [App] âœ… Loaded 2 user clips

# TROUBLESHOOTING
# ---------------
# If you see "Missing or insufficient permissions":
# - Check Firestore rules are updated
# - Check Storage rules are updated
# - Wait 1-2 minutes for rules to propagate

# If you see "Object does not exist" in Storage:
# - This means Storage rules are blocking upload
# - Update Storage rules (not Firestore rules)

# If no Firebase logs appear:
# - Check GoogleService-Info.plist is added to project
# - Check Firebase packages are installed
# - Check FirebaseApp.configure() is called in app init

# FREE TIER LIMITS
# ----------------
# Firebase Storage: 5 GB storage, 1 GB/day downloads
# Firebase Firestore: 1 GB storage, 50,000 reads/day, 20,000 writes/day
# Firebase Auth: 10,000 users/month
# 
# Typical usage per user:
# - Audio file: ~2-5 MB per clip
# - 5 GB free = ~1,000-2,500 clips per user
# - 1 GB/day downloads = ~200-500 clips played per day
