# Supabase Setup Instructions

## Current Status
The app is currently using a mock implementation of SupabaseManager to allow the app to build and run without the Supabase SDK properly linked.

## To Enable Real Supabase Integration:

### 1. In Xcode:
1. Open your project in Xcode
2. Select your project in the navigator
3. Select your app target
4. Go to the "General" tab
5. Scroll to "Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content"
6. Click the "+" button
7. Search for and add:
   - `Supabase`
   - `Auth` 
   - `Realtime`
   - `Storage`
   - `PostgresNIO`
   - `Functions`

### 2. Replace Mock Implementation:
Once the Supabase package is properly linked:
1. Delete the current `SupabaseManager.swift`
2. Create a new file with the real Supabase implementation (backup saved as `SupabaseManager_real.swift.backup`)

### 3. Test Authentication:
- Email/Password login works with the mock implementation
- Real Supabase auth will work once the SDK is linked

## Database Information:
- **URL**: https://mpuzozdhltxfcozxsawo.supabase.co

- All tables are created and ready with proper RLS policies

## Features Ready:
✅ Authentication (Email/Password, Google OAuth ready)
✅ User profiles
✅ Messaging system
✅ Track storage
✅ Collaborations
✅ Friend system
✅ Audio file storage

## Mock Mode Features:
While in mock mode, the app will:
- Accept any email/password for login
- Create temporary user sessions
- Not persist data to Supabase
- Show demo data only
